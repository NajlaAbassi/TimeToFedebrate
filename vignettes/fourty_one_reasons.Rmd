This small function/package was created to celebrate the 41th birthday of Federico Marini. It's our way of expressing our appreciation and admiration. Curious to see what it's all about? Let's dive in!

Let's start by loading the library:

```{r}
library("TimeToFedebrate")
```

Then, all you have to do is play with numbers. Let's start with reason number 1:

```{r}
we_depend_on_you(1)
```

do you already get why this vignette is called 41 reasons :)? Let's try with another number:

```{r}
we_depend_on_you(5)
```

At this point, the console is your friend in discovering what the rest of the numbers hold ;)

Happy Birthday, Federico, from all of us in the Bioinformatics Group! ‚ù§Ô∏è üéâ
